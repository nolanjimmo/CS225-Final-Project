# CS225-Final-Project

﻿#My Goal
 
My goal in this project was to create a language (Data Types and an interpreter) for a language that implemented a pairs data type, as well as a "tagged unions" (or dijoint union) data type. I based this language off of a general language with simple addition, boolean comparison, let statements, variables, etc. and implemented the language with an environment type of storage for stored expressions, variable names, etc.

﻿#Starting Point

I did just cut and paste any of the languages or homeowork solutions, but based on the base elements that I then added the paris and tagged union types to, I would say it was closest to L3, and HW04 from the course.

﻿#Finishing Point

I'm not going to lie, I struggled through a lot of this project. Ultimately I have gotten to what I believe to be complete Data Types list, and a complete interpreter. I do not currently have the tests running from the testing folder in my  repository, but I was able to use "gchi" to manually test previously (I just don't have any idea how I could translate that into the repository). I do have tests written in the testsFP folder, and I worked hard to figure out why my interpreter.hs won't run those tests, but I haven't been able to figure it out. The testing strucuture I used within interpreter.hs is similar to that of HW03, so I'm sure you guys could just peak at what syntactic thing I must be missing to get those tests to run.

﻿#Expectations

At first, just being sort of overhwhelmed by not knowing truly what I was supposed to accomplish was the hardest part. After I had office hours with June on this project, it really helped me get over that mental barrier and I was able to make a lot of great progress right after that. The other major thing that tripped me up, throughout the course as well, was just Haskell syntax. I felt like I had a good understanding about what we were doing with pattern matching and type matching and all of those conceptual things we worked through in the homeworks, but I also just struggled with getting what I was trying to do into Haskell. That definitely continued into this project as well.

I will say that once I was able to get help and figure out what parts of the Data Types I was missing, I felt confident writing and working through the mistakes that I found in my compiler. I suppose that isn't surprising that that was an easier part, as that is what we did in pretty much every homework, but it was cool that that all clicked in this project.

﻿#Testing

Like I said before, this is the biggest struggle I had here at the end of the project. Trying to figure out a way to get the tests to run. I have written the test, they are in the testsFP folder, so if you guys can find a way to fix the mistake I am making in getting those tests to run, they should run just fine.
